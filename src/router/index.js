/**
 * If you use React Router you might have noticed they recently added a number of useful hooks, 
 * specifically useParams, useLocation, useHistory, and use useRouteMatch. But let's see if we can make it even simpler 
 * by wrapping them up into a single useRouter hook that exposes just the data and methods we need. In this recipe we 
 * show how easy it is to compose multiple hooks and combine their returned state into a single object. It makes a lot 
 * of sense for libraries like React Router to offer a selection of low-level hooks, as using only the hook you need can 
 * minimize unnecessary re-renders. That said, sometimes you want a simpler developer experience and custom hooks make that easy.
